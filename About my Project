Q01=Write-up on Project?
Ans:My Project was a image geneation project with the help of insufficient image data.It was basically used in the semicundoector chips menufecturing.
If any chip is a difctive then we can seperate those chips by clicking the picture in the inital time and correct the issue using this application.
It has three module GAN,Blending,Image processing.

Q02=What is a challenge you face.
Ans:In the staring of the project we were developing the user signup and login process.But in the third milestone our korian team developed some codev api 
and we were responsible for calling those apies for login and user signup in our gaudi application but there was role based authentication in those api and
during testing those api's implementation we need to take credentials for every role present.Even we don't have the access for the database for rolebased 
table.
